# soTired

## Motivation

soTired is an application for cognitive fatigue assessment.
It includes a stand-alone Android-App for fatigue detection and an additional part for data management and further analysis.
The project is structured in a client side (stand-alone App) implemented in Dart/Flutter and a server side (data management) in Golang.
Dart/Flutter provides the ability to simply add an iOS, desktop and / or web application besides Android.


soTired is a remake of the application presented in the [Validation of a Smartphone-Based Approach to In Situ Cognitive Fatigue Assessment](https://mhealth.jmir.org/2017/8/e125) paper by Edward Price, George Moore, Leo Galway and Mark Linden.
